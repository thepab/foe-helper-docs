# City planner

## What can this tool do?
To plan different variants of a city or to have a guild colleague or friend plan the city, this tool is just the right thing.<br>
You can pass on a share link, which enables the editor to plan your city.

## Overview

You can access the city planner at the top of the website via the "Tools" menu:

![Link to the city planner](./.images/citymap-link.png)

Your cities appear in the overview. Your capital, but also all your outposts if you have uploaded and saved them here:

## Edit city

Click on "New city" to see which data is available.
are available. You must have sent this data from the FoE helper extension to this server.<br>
This will usually be your city itself and/or the last outpost you sent.

All buildings are always on the map when you first call them up. Your city is also built like this.

---

Click on "Remove buildings" to move all buildings on the map to the left in the site bar.

---

You can also mark individual buildings with CTRL + left mouse button...

... and move it to the sidebar with the "Del" key.

![Moved individual buildings](./.images/moved-single-buildings.png)

With Shift + left mouse button you can draw a square, starting outside the map, over the buildings that you want to send to the sidebar with the "Del" key:

![Draw square](./.images/mark-with-rectangle.png)

<div data-gb-custom-block data-tag="hint" data-style='info'>
All buildings that touch the orange square are taken into account. The building does not have to lie completely within it.
</div>

![Marked buildings](./.images/selected-with-rectangle.png)

![Marked buildings removed](./.images/moved-with-rectangle.png)


With these aids, you don't have to push every single building to the left. Which of course also works.

---

There are two options for saving. The first time you save, you will be asked for a name.<br>
If you have saved successfully, your city will be saved automatically in the background every 30 seconds.

!["Save by name" modal](./.images/cityname-modal.png)

![Saved!](./.images/modal-city-saved.png)

If you open an existing city, it is immediately saved in the background every 30 seconds after opening. So no progress is lost.

---

If you do not have more monitors, YOU can save your city either as a graphic or as a transparent PNG graphic.<br>
You do this with the buttons "PDF Download" or "PNG Download".



## Share city

If you want someone else to plan your city for you, you can create a "Share Link" in the overview.:

![Create share link](./.images/create-share-link.png)

---

Click on copy to copy it to the clipboard of your device.:

![Share Link erstellen](./.images/copy-share-link.png)

<div data-gb-custom-block data-tag="hint" data-style='warning'>
If you delete the share link, the city cannot be called up again under this link. You have to create a new one and share it again.
</div>
